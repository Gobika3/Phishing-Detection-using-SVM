# Phishing Detection System using Support Vector Machine (SVM)  

## Project Overview  
The Phishing Detection System is a machine learning project that aims to identify phishing websites based on their features.  
It applies a Support Vector Machine (SVM) classifier to detect whether a given website is **legitimate** or **phishing**, helping users stay safe from online frauds and cyberattacks.  

This project was completed as part of my BCA degree and was later published as a research paper titled *“Phishing Detection with Support Vector Machine”* (June 2023, Volume 4, Issue 3).

## Features  
- Collects and preprocesses website URL features.  
- Trains an SVM classifier for phishing detection.  
- Evaluates model performance using accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.  
- Classifies a given website as **Legitimate** or **Phishing**.  
- Provides a scalable and extendable approach for cybersecurity applications.

## Technologies Used  
- **Programming Language**: Python  
- **Libraries**:  
  - `scikit-learn` – Machine learning and SVM implementation  
  - `pandas`, `numpy` – Data preprocessing and feature handling  
  - `matplotlib`, `seaborn` – Data visualization  
- **Dataset**: Phishing website dataset (UCI repository or custom collected)
